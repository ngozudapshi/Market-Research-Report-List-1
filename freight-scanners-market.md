<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Freight Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual View X-ray Scanner</li><li>Single View X-ray Scanner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The freight scanners market comprises two main types: dual view X-ray scanners and single view X-ray scanners. Dual view X-ray scanners use two separate X-ray sources, enabling them to capture images from different angles simultaneously, which enhances detection capabilities and provides a more comprehensive view of cargo contents. In contrast, single view X-ray scanners utilize a single X-ray source, offering a simpler and often more cost-effective solution for cargo inspection, but with limited imaging depth and detail.</p></p>
