<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TFT LCD Driver ICs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Source Driver</li><li>Gate Driver</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The TFT LCD driver ICs market is primarily divided into two segments: source drivers and gate drivers. Source driver ICs control the voltage applied to each pixel column, managing the brightness and color accuracy by directly driving the individual pixels. Gate driver ICs, on the other hand, control the row selection by sequentially enabling transistor switches that connect the pixel rows to the display circuitry. Both types are integral for achieving high-resolution and efficient performance in TFT LCD displays.</p></p>
