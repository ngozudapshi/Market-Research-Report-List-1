<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs) Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li> Cleave and Degrade</li><li>Splice </li></ul></p>
<p><p>Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drugs target specific RNA molecules to modulate gene expression. The market can be categorized into two main types: cleave and degrade, and splice modulation. Cleave and degrade ASOs employ RNase H enzymes to degrade complementary RNA, effectively silencing genes. In contrast, splice modulation ASOs alter pre-mRNA splicing, leading to the production of beneficial protein variants or the exclusion of harmful sequences. Both approaches offer targeted therapies for genetic disorders and other diseases, enabling precise treatment strategies.</p></p>
